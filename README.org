* LispVM intepreter

This program inteprets LispVM bytecode, which is currently a ASCII format.

Each LispVM executable starts with the magic sequence "lispvm".
Currently, there is no header.
Instruction arguments appear inline, since there is no memory or register access yet.

** Current instruction set
| Op   | Description                                        |
|------+----------------------------------------------------|
| p    | Prints the string after the op, until it hits NULL |
| q    | Quits gracefully.                                  |
| '\0' | Aborts execution.                                  |
